   - Dataset: Student performance, learning patterns, course completion rates
   - Model: Recommendation systems, collaborative filtering
   - Purpose: Suggest optimal learning sequences

2. PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS:
   - Dataset: Historical student data, engagement metrics, assessment scores
   - Model: Classification/regression models
   - Purpose: Early intervention for at-risk students

3. INTELLIGENT CONTENT RECOMMENDATION:
   - Dataset: Course materials, student preferences, learning outcomes
   - Model: Natural language processing, content-based filtering
   - Purpose: Recommend relevant learning materials

4. AUTOMATED ASSESSMENT:
   - Dataset: Question banks, student responses, grading patterns
   - Model: NLP for essay grading, pattern recognition
   - Purpose: Automated assignment evaluation

5. LEARNING ANALYTICS:
   - Dataset: User interaction logs, time-on-task, click patterns
   - Model: Clustering, anomaly detection
   - Purpose: Identify learning patterns and optimize content

POTENTIAL DATASETS FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:
- Student performance records
